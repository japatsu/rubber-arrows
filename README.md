# Rubber Arrows - a Foundry VTT Module

A stretching arrow that you can use to point out details, routes, and other important things on the screen to your fellow players.

# Installation

In your Foundry VTT 
- Navigate to `Configuration and Setup screen -> Add-on Modules -> Install Module`
- For `Manifest URL`, put in: `https://github.com/japatsu/rubber-arrows/releases/latest/module.json`
- Click `Install`

# Features

Read on to find out what it does and how you use the tool.

## Easy

Activate the tool, left-click and start dragging, and there's your pointer. Release the button and it's gone. That's it.

The tool activates from the controls menu or with a hot-key (see below).

## Waypoints

You can choose to go with simple, straight arrows, or get fancy with multi-segmented, angled arrows suitable for route marking.

While drawing the arrow, right-click starts a new segment. 

## Hot-key toggle

When the hot-key is pressed, Rubber Arrow tool activates. It stays active until the hot-key gets released, and then the previous tool is re-activated automatically. 

Using the hot-key removes the need to search for the tool - and when you're done, it zeroes the clicks you need to get back where you were.

The default hot-key is `LeftShift`. You can change it to your liking from `Game settings -> Configure Controls -> Rubber Arrows`.

If you, for some reason, rather use the tool menu, you can find Rubber Arrows from there too.

## Customizable

As a GM user you can change the overall behavior of the tool and the appereance of the arrows.

Take a look at `Game settings -> Configure Settings -> Rubber Arrows`. 

Available options should be quite self-explaining. Try tinkering with them and see if what happens.
